# Newton's Fractal

I've elected to try to make a nice little app to mess around with Newton's Fractals, as per Grant Sanderson's recent [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RdOwhmqP5s&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown).

## Attempt 1 - 31/10/2021

I've made the first version, I think it turned out pretty nice looking:

The colours are changeable, but unfortunately the polynomial is fairly permanent. Other areas to improve include putting onto the GPU, because, duh. I don't know how to do that yet, so a fun future project!
